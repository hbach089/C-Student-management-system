# Student file system

Used C programming language to create a simple student record management system mainly to enhance my C knowledge.

## Key concepts
&ensp;• Dynamic memory allocation (**malloc** and **free**).  
&ensp;•	Linked list data structure manipulation and implementation.  
&ensp;• Handling files using standard library functions such as **fopen**, **fseek**, **rewind**, **fprintf**, and **fscanf**.  
&ensp;• Working	with custom header files.

## Setup and Installation
&ensp;• Ensure that GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is installed on your system.  
&ensp;• Compile the FILES.c file using GCC.  
&ensp;• Run the executable.  

## Next steps
